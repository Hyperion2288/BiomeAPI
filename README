BiomeAPI for Minecraft 1.2.5
By Hyperion88 (Hyperion2288 on github because someone sucks)

This is a minecraft mod made to make biome mods easier to make and to be compatible with one another.

Currently a single document of documentation is lacking but going through sources in the repository should give a good enough idea.
ModLoader is required for this api.

TODO:
A more costomizable replacement to GenLayer (sort of working on a 2d perlin noise generator)
Better spawnCreature support
SMP support
Automatic config support (finished?)
Hook into ChunkProviderGenerate (maybe)
